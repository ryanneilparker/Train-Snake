    <h1>Snakey - How to Play</h1>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
      Eat as much food as possible and avoid colliding with walls or the
      snake's own body.
    </p>
    <h2>Controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Arrow keys</strong> - Use the arrow keys to control the
        snake's direction: up, down, left, or right.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The game starts with a snake consisting of a single segment on a
        bordered game board.
      </li>
      <li>
        The snake moves continuously in the direction specified by the arrow
        keys.
      </li>
      <li>
        The snake can wrap around the screen edges and appear on the opposite
        side.
      </li>
      <li>Food items are randomly placed on the game board.</li>
      <li>
        When the snake eats food, it grows longer by adding a segment to its
        tail.
      </li>
      <li>
        The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <p>
      The player earns points for each food item consumed. The score increases
      with each successful consumption.
    </p>
    <h2>Game Over</h2>
    <p>
      The game is over when the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
      The final score is displayed, and the player can choose to restart the
      game.
